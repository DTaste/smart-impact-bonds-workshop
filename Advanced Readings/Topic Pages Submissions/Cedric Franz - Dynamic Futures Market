# Impact Bonds - using a dynamic "futures" market

## Introduction
Impact Bonds are highly reliant on intermediaries to negotiate the rules of engagement.  The intermediaries need to monitor,
measure and validate outcomes and enforce contractual terms. This requires considerable professional expertise, time and 
skills to negotiate, manage and execute. By introducing public proofs and game theory into this process a large amount of this 
work can be automated.

## Public Proofs
By using technologies like blockchain, where data can be ledgered and then publicly proven, the work done with respect to 
impact work can also be ledgered.  This allows for anyone to ascertain the authenticity of the work, by looking at the people (or 
systems) who delivered the work and those who validated it, a deduction could be made as to the projects value. Since on a blockchain every 
record is cryptographically signed the information cannot be disputed.

## Dynamic Futures Market
Each impact project stipulates its outcomes.  A fungible tradeable asset could be created to represent this project's future outcomes. 
This asset could be bought and sold by impact investors.  It would work similar to the Futures market.  When the project 
is starting out, its value is based on its potential to complete, but the risk is high and so is the potential reward.  As the project nears completion the risk 
decreases, so the value should increase. This creates an opportunity for impact investors to buy and sell the future value of 
projects based on their knowledge of whether they will complete or fail.  Once a project completes the impact investor will pay 
for the project and gain the assets that it generated.

This gamification mechanism incentives good projects to complete, but also kills off bad projects quickly. 
Consider a vaccination project at a clinic to deliver 1000 vaccinations and let's say that an impact investor would pay $100 per 
vaccination.  In the current ecosystem there would be a whole lot of negotiations to set this up. With gamification, consider 
the clinic creates a project Future Asset on a public dashboard of its intention to deliver the 1000 vaccinations and sets the price 
of the Future to $100 000. If an impact investor buys the Future the clinic begins the project knowing that if it delivers 
the 1000 vaccinations, and abides by the publicly available contract criteria, it will receive the value of the Future currently priced at $100 000.  

If the project 
exceeds expectations and is delivered more quickly and more accurately than originally planned the impact investor might 
sell the Future to another investor for more and thereby make a profit.  The clinic might then receive $110 per vaccination. 
If the project is running behind, then the Future value might decrease. This incentivises initiatives to improve the project 
delivery and get it back on track, as the clinic might only then receive $85 per vaccination if it does not. If the clinic decides the project will no longer be profitable, then they might end it and try to recoup costs.

Smart contracts can be used to setup the Futures asset as well as the marketplace for trading these projects.  

## Conclusion
By doing this, the whole impact investment process can be changed from a push process to a pull process.  Where projects are 
now funded upfront and the impact investor has to "push" to ensure the project completes, it now changes to a "pull" process 
where the impact investor "dangles a carrot" to the project owner to complete the project as well as possible and according to expectations.
